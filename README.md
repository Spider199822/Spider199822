- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Spider199822 
I'm most of time try to learn what I really need and I'm fastlearner if I can find the best and up-to-date resources.
I've got a stackoverflow account too. 
If anyone wanna reach me just send me here, that is the quickest way to reach me.
I'm working with the Vira company 
last thing is that I interested in Machhine learning and Math and computation and NLP.
I've got strong background of math and computer.
NLP is the one of the most difficult part of AI.
working with data enjoyable for me especially the hard ones like texts .
